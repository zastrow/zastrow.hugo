    title: Grid System
    section: Systems
    ---

    The grid system we are using for page layouts is based on a #{$count} column grid. Grid classes can be nested if needed for more complex layouts.

    Most grid layouts are going to use either a two, three, or four column layout. The basic grid system includes all of the classes needed to create a simple layout with class names that are spelled out and easy to read.

    Each `#{settings(prefix)}-grid-cell-` class can have a responsive suffix to adjust the grid column span a different screen sizes. The #{$count} column count of `#{settings(prefix)}-grid-block` remain persistent at all screen sizes.

    ### Grid Block Class

    To define a grid, an element must have the `#{settings(prefix)}-grid-block` class. This will apply a `display: grid` along with fallback styles for browsers that do not support CSS Grid.

  .#{settings(prefix)}-grid-block {
    @include clearfix;
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;

    @supports (display: grid) {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(#{$count}, 1fr);

      // Removes `clearfix` pseudo element from the grid
      &::after {
        content: none;
        display: none;
      }
    }
  }
}
