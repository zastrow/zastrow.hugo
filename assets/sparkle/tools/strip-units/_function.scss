  title: Strip Units Function
  section: Tools
  ---
  Removes the unit of number. This is handy for maths in mixins/functions, for example if you need to check to values of two numbers. If one is a `em` value and the other is a `rem` value, you have to strip the units to accomplish the math.

  **Use**
  ```scss
  .my-class {
    prop: strip-units(<number>);
  }
  ```
  */
}

@function strip-units($number) {
  @return $number / ($number * 0 + 1);
}
