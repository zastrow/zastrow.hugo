<p>In all reality this is my third or fourth crack at running a blog. Like each iteration before, I’m using a different system. Previously I have used <a href="http://www.joomla.org">Joomla!</a> and <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>. Both systems are great for managing content, but I find them inadequate for creating content. They do well to try and make things simple for techie and non-techie alike. But, I have never found writing to be simple or easy.</p>
<h3 id="enter-second-crack">Enter Second Crack</h3>
<p>This version of Phanza is built on <a href="http://www.marco.org">Marco Arment</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack">Second Crack</a> static-file blog engine. What is so wonderful and attractive about this system is it’s use of <a href="http://db.tt/UWXAuH0">Dropbox</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. The system, once set up, is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.txt</code> file in your favorite text editor, <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom</a>.</li>
<li>Write your content using Markdown format.</li>
<li>Save file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once that is done, two scripts run on your server. The first syncs your Dropbox folder to the server. The second script takes file from the Dropbox folder and creates a HTML page.</p>
<p>Now, the process to get this system is certainly not for beginners. I barely qualify to setup this system myself. Marco is quick to point out on Second Crack’s <a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack/blob/master/README.markdown">README</a> that this system “should be considered an early alpha” and probably should not be used in live environments.</p>
<p>With that warning in mind, I decided to use Second Crack for its ease of use and programming challenge. It took a week’s worth of free-time to get this up and running, plus two full weekends. I ran into problems and had to backtrack on many occasions. But in the end, I gleaned copious amounts of information and a great learning experience.</p>
<p>I’m very interested to see what happens with this go around of Phanza.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>Please note, Phanza no longer uses Second Crack.</p>
