<p>Ben Callahan of <a href="http://www.seesparkbox">Sparkbox</a> tackles hands-on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive</a> and adaptive web design. You can view Benâ€™s presentation over at <a href="http://speakerdeck.com/u/bencallahan/p/an-introduction-to-responsive-adaptive-web-design">SpeakerDeck</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite portion of his deck comes at slide 34. Here he lists a short  Pros/Cons list when deciding whether to go for large resolutions first or small resolutions first (a.k.a. mobile first). Good things to think about. Sparkbox prefers mobile first and Ben goes on to explain why.</p>
