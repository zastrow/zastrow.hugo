<p>This is the type of missional action I love to see. Take something you have a talent with. Mix it with something you have a passion for. Which comes together as something extraordinary.</p>
<p>Sevenly creates really great looking t-shirts focusing on a weekly cause. Then for every shirt sold they give $7, about 30%, to a non-profit that focuses on that cause.</p>
<p>This week they are raising awareness for Autism with all funds going to support <a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/">Autism Speaks</a>.</p>
