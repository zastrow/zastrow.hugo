<p>A new project from the folks <a href="http://www.seesparkbox.com">Sparkbox</a> encourages “responsive-building, media-querying web citizens” to dress responsively. Right now they’re trying to build interest in the apparel. The project started off to as a mock project for Sparkbox’s <a href="http://buildresponsively.com/">Build Responsively</a> workshop, but now they’d like to see it come to life.</p>
<p>Sparkbox has six t-shirt designs up for a vote. If there is sufficient interest they’ll have the winner printed and available for sale. As of this writing the current leader is called “<a href="http://www.dressresponsively.com/shirt/4">Friends Helping Friends</a>” with 31 votes. Check out the shirts and vote!</p>
