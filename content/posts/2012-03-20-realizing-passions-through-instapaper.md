title: Realizing Passions Through Instapaper

<p>One of my all-time favorite applications is <a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> by <a href="http://www.marco.org">Marco Arment</a>. I initially used this service as only a bookmarking tool. When I got an iPad I realized the true utility of Instapaper with the <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/iphone">native app</a> and began hitting the “Read Later” bookmarklet in my browser rabidly.</p>
<p>Now, after a couple years of Instapaper use, a pattern has emerged in what I “Read Later”. I’ve also noticed that I send a large number of articles into my Instapaper queue, and it takes a while before being read. But, that’s why I’m reading it later, right?<sup id="fnref:-2012-03-20"><a href="#fn:1-2012-03-20" class="cmp-footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This pattern I’ve discovered is that the articles I tend to save can be categorized into my passions and major interests. Me? I’m a Jesus-following, technology-intrigued, social-justice wannabe, web designer.<sup id="fnref:-2012-03-20"><a href="#fn:2" class="cmp-footnote">2</a></sup> The articles I virtually throw into Instapaper follow a similar flow.</p>
<p>The five latest additions to the queue are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://theotherjournal.com/amishjihadi/2012/03/19/the-non-existence-of-evil-free-thinking-and-kants-love-child/">The Non-Existence of Evil, Free Thinking, and Kant’s Love Child</a></li>
<li><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jw_on_tech/archive/2012/03/13/why-i-left-google.aspx?utm_source=WhatCounts+Publicaster+Edition&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Almost+Timely+Newsletter+from+%40cspenn+for+3%2f18%2f12&amp;utm_content=Click+here+to+read+more+»">Why I left Google</a></li>
<li><a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120318/the-failures-and-fallacies-of-mike-daiseys-apple-attack-and-the-media/">The Failures and Fallacies of Mike Daisey’s Apple Attack and the Media</a></li>
<li><a href="http://frankviola.org/2011/05/05/beyond-evangelical-part-i-–-a-third-alternative/">Beyond Evangelical: Part I</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1710844,00.html">Christians Wrong About Heaven, Says Bishop</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Regarding the above, I’ve only read the first article. It’s good. I very much enjoy <a href="http://theotherjournal.com/amishjihadi/">The Amish Jihadist</a>’s writing style, whether or not I agree with what he opines.</p>
<p>Concerning the remaining four, I’ll probably only skim the second and third articles. I’m interested in the topics, but not so much to read every word.<sup id="fnref:-2012-03-20"><a href="#fn:3" class="cmp-footnote">3</a></sup> As far as articles four and five. I’ll read four…at some point. Article five though, that’s going to be read next. That could just be a link-bait title, but they’ve got me hooked.<sup id="fnref:-2012-03-20"><a href="#fn:4" class="cmp-footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>While the latest five articles are not entirely indicative of what I read, it is a good glimpse. There are certainly articles missing that fall in the realm of my profession, but they are there. Although I certainly have articles well outside the pattern identified, this is an observation of the majority.</p>
<p>Two things I would like to note. One, although there may be commonalities in topics many articles contain opposing viewpoints or opinions. Two, a vast majority of the links that land in my Instapaper queue stem from Twitter, especially <a href="http://twitter.com/jrforasteros">these</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/bencallahan">folks</a>.</p>
<div class="cmp-footnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Right.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:-2012-03-20" class="cmp-footnotes__return-link">&#9650;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>Can I throw idiot or moron in there? I’m feeling especially esteem-deprived today.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:-2012-03-20" class="cmp-footnotes__return-link">&#9650;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>In the case of the Mike Daisey article, I’m aware of <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/460/retraction">the situation</a> and this article is likely not adding to what I know.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:-2012-03-20" class="cmp-footnotes__return-link">&#9650;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>Touché TIME.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:-2012-03-20" class="cmp-footnotes__return-link">&#9650;</a></p>
</li>
