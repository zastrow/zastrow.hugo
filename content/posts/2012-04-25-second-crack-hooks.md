<p>Finally doing some updating on the code-side of Phanza. I’ve been wanting to try out the hook abilities for some time. It is quite appealing to have your latest blog post be sent to Twitter automatically.</p>
<p>I know I talk about it too much<sup id="fnref:1-2012-04-25"><a href="#fn:1-2012-04-25" class="cmp-footnote">1</a></sup>, but if you are a tinkerer like me you’ll enjoy messing around with <a href="https://github.com/marcoarment/secondcrack">Second Crack</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>Please note, Phanza no longer uses Second Crack.</p>
<div class="cmp-footnotes">

<p>I don’t have much else to talk about anyway.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref:1-2012-04-25" class="cmp-footnotes__return-link">&#9650;</a></p>
