<p>Nice article on Smashing on making web content more readable. Make sure youâ€™re giving your body content room to breathe. That content is the reason your website exists.</p>
<p>My one gripe is the font stacks that are presented. Why would Helvetica be placed as the fallback to Arial in the font stack and not the other way around?  I stated my confusion with this on <a href="https://twitter.com/zastrow/status/197759093262393346">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jonathanstegall/status/197759867803541505">Jonathan Stegall</a> points out that this is the default font stack in Dreamweaver.</p>
<p>Oh, Adobe.</p>
