<p>I thoroughly enjoy reading <a href="http://www.norvillerogers.com/good-news-the-avengers-ruined-super-hero-movies/">JR Forasteros’s blog</a>. His latest post detailing how <em>The Avengers</em> has changed the model of Super Hero movies is really great.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Super-hero movies must become more character- and story-driven if they want to thrive in a post-Avengers world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He discusses the formula for a great summer blockbuster. Then gets into the difference between <em>The Avengers</em> and Christopher Nolan’s fantastic Batman movies.</p>
