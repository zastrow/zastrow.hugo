<p>Dan Benjamin of <a href="http://www.5by5.tv">5by5</a> quickly discusses the the abrupt programming change that occured late last week. I, as others, were quite surprised to hear that The Talk Show along with host, John Gruber, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/05/18/the-talk-show">moved</a> from 5by5 to the <a href="http://muleradio.net/thetalkshow/">Mule Radio Syndicate</a>. This move means that Dan will no longer co-host The Talk Show with John, a dynamic that kept me tuned in.</p>
<p>Though I’m sad to see this change occur, I am quite excited about Dan’s recently announced show, <a href="http://5by5.tv/bigweek">Big Week</a>. This is a new 5by5 show hosted by Dan, described as “news and discussion at the intersection of culture and technology.”</p>
<p>Can’t wait.</p>
