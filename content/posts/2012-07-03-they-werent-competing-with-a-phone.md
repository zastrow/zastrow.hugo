<p><a href="http://techpinions.com/author/johnkirk">John Kirk</a> at <a href="http://techpinions.com/">TechPinions</a> on RIM and the disruption of the iPhone:</p>
<blockquote><p>Palm, Nokia, RIM and Microsofts Windows Mobile thought they were safe from another phone competitor – especially one that wasnt that great a phone and didn’t even come with a keyboard. They were right. But what Palm, Nokia, RIM and Microsoft didn’t realize was they weren’t competing with a phone. They were competing with a pocket computer.</p></blockquote>
