<p>A few weeks ago I wrote “<a href="http://phanza.com/2012/07/31/the-broken-design-process">The Broken Design Process</a>" in response to Erik Runyons "<a href="http://weedygarden.net/2012/07/why-i-stopped-using-8-decimal-point-widths-and-you-should-too/">Why I Stopped Using 8 Decimal Point Widths and You Should Too</a>". Last week <a href="https://twitter.com/kazuhito/">Kazuhito Kidachi</a> requested permission to translate “The Broken Design Process” to Japanese. His translation is now up on his site, <a href="http://kidachi.kazuhi.to/blog/archives/037559.html">kazuhi.to</a>.</p>
