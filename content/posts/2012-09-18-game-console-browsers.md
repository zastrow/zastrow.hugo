<p>I finally got around to reading Anna Debenham’s <em>A List Apart</em> article from last week on game console browsers. She definitely did her research. I’m surprised by some of the information, I didn’t expect the usage of game console browser to be so high. She wraps up with the more important point, that we need to consider all contexts and make the design as streamlined and accessible as possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can’t tailor experiences for every possible use case on every device, but we can use what we know about console web browsing to build a better overall experience. Like we’ve done by designing with mobile in mind, considering how a site could be used on a console can have a knock-on effect of making it easier to use overall.</p>
