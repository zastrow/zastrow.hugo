title: Sparkbox Foundry – Confessions of a Designer Developer

<p>I wrote my first article for the <a href="http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/">Sparkbox Foundry</a>. In the article I write about my failures and misconceptions as a self-taught developer, and how I learned from these mistakes. I’ve found stories like these empowering and encouraging. Hopefully my confessions will do the same for others.</p>
