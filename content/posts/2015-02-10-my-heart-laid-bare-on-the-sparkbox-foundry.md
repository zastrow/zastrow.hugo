<p>Most of my writing over the last year and a half has not occurred on this site, but rather over at the <a href="http://seesparkbox.com/foundry">Sparkbox Foundry</a>. My latest article was posted there yesterday and it dives into some deeper, less discussed topics covered on the Foundry. In the article I discuss several lies I have internalized and how I have dealt with them throughout my career. While I am wearing my heart on my sleeve in this article, my expectations were low to see any reaction to what I wrote. I have received a lot of encouragement and positive reception in the last 24 hours, and I am so glad this has resonated with others.</p>
