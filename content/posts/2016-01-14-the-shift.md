<p>Today, Sparkbox launched a community writing project called <a href="https://twitter.com/startYourShift">The Shift</a>. Each month a new topic is selected and the whole web industry is then invited to write on that topic. Whether it be posted on a company blog, as a Facebook post, or a Medium article, the hope is to spur a large conversation with diverse thoughts and responses.</p>
<p>From Sparkbox:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>a topic is announced on the first Monday of each month</li>
<li>if you’re able to contribute, you announce publicly that you’re participating in this shift using “#startYourShift” hashtag<br />
-everyone is invited to research, consider, and publish about that topic on the last Friday of the month at noon Eastern</li>
<li>all contributors share a link to their piece using “#startYourShift” hashtag on Twitter and any other platforms where they please</li>
<li>we all get to be part of an industry-wide conversation on a specific topic</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The inaugural topic is “How to Make the Web Better.” You can <a href="http://seesparkbox.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=c2fcafb7ccc2db34e99075bb1&amp;id=bb05c6c1af">sign up</a> to be notified about The Shift topic for the month, and get reminders as the deadline approaches for each topic. I plan on participating as much as I can on this site, I hope you will as well. Be sure to follow The Shift’s <a href="https://twitter.com/startYourShift">Twitter</a> and checkout <a href="http://seesparkbox.com/foundry">The Foundry</a> to see what a Sparkboxer might have to say.</p>
