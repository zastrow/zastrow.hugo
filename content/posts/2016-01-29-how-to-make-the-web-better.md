<h2 id="who-browsers-are-for">Who Browsers Are For</h2>
<p>The most pivitol tool a web developer uses day in and day out is a browser. They are what we develop for. Browsers can equally enstill excitement and dread throughout a project. As a web developer, it can be hard to maintain perspective of the purpose of browser—to meet the needs of the typical user.</p>
<p>As developers we want the browsers’ primary focus to be on making feature-packed, standards-based browsers. We want really great built-in tools to debug our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And when we come across bugs in one browser and not another we curse its name be declaring it the <em>new IE</em>! The perspective we have to keep in mind though is that most users of a browser, are not developers.</p>
<p>Browsers are justsoftware and there are bound to be bugs and issues. Thankfully most browser makers have instituted short release timeframes to take care of minor bugs quickly. But even so, the browser makers’ priority is a feature rich experience for the user. These are features that aren’t associated to any standards, but instead provide the user with preferencial features. One of the reasons I prefer to use Safari has my main browser is the built-in feed reader and tabs syncing. Other browsers offer these features as well, but I like how Safari does it.</p>
<p>Browsers aren’t primarily made for developers, but they are a vital community to a browsers survival. At that web developers are completely reliant on the existance of state of browsers to accomplish their job. We need to maintain constant dialogue between web developers and browser makers.</p>
<h2 id="report-bugs">Report Bugs</h2>
<p>All the major browser makers have teams dedicated to reviewing and prioritizing bugs. Browsers are probably the biggest form of customizable software, taking in a set of parameters from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and rendering them on the page. They cannot account for all problems, nor may they experience the same pain points you are running into day after day. Instead of lementing that the current browser is the new IE, log a bug report and make the web better.</p>
<p>Here is where you can log a bug for each major browser maker:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.chromium.org/for-testers/bug-reporting-guidelines">Chromium</a> (Chrome)</li>
<li><a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/Feedback">Edge</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.mdn">Firefox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bugs.opera.com/wizard/">Opera</a></li>
<li><a href="https://webkit.org/reporting-bugs">WebKit</a> (Safari)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="follow-the-browsers">Follow The Browsers</h2>
<p>Additionally consider following the Twitter accounts, blogs, and mailing lists of all the browsers to be aware of what they are up to. WebKit has a great <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/">blog</a>, Chromium has a very active <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/discussion-groups">community forum</a>, and Opera is quite intent on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/opera">tweeting</a> all kinds of things.</p>
<h2 id="make-the-web-better-throughengagement">Make The Web Better Through Engagement</h2>
<p>The voice of the developer is important to the browser maker. Lamenting short-comings and complaing about a lack of support doesn’t help fix those problems. We can tweet twelve times a day how much we don’t like Safari’s JavaScript tools, but won’t fix it. Tell the browser makers what you don’t like, what will help you make better websites. They have avenues to listen, but they need to be utilized, otherwise we’re just yelling at inanimate screens.</p>
<p>Take the time to document and report a bug, and make the web better.</p>
