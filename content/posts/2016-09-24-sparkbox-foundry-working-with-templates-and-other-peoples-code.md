<p>Purchased templates get a bad wrap. Up until early this summer I was on the bandwagon, deriding the use of templates. But, then my colleagues and I had an instance where it made since on a project. My mind has shifted to understand why and how agencies can utilize prefab web templates to meet the needs of their clients. However, there are things to keep in mind when choosing this approach. Hopefully <a href="https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/working_with_templates_and_other_peoples_code">my article</a> on the <a href="https://seesparkbox.com/foundry">Sparkbox Foundry</a> we be a useful guide for those weighing such a decision.</p>
