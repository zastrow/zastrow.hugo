<p>Iâ€™ve heard Ben Thompson pop up on <a href="http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/">The Talk Show</a> every now and then, but last summer I was introduced to his podcast, <a href="http://exponent.fm">Exponent</a>. In their 100th episode, Ben and co-host James Allworth give detail the world since the introduction of the iPhone ten years ago. This is possibly the most quintessential episode of Exponent. If you have never listened to the podcast, this is a great place to start.</p>
