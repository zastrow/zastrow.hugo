<p>A couple of weeks ago I started the Daily CSS Image. If you are not familiar with the challenge, it is a person challenge, not a competition. Each weekday an email is sent with a topic or object to create using only CSS, with the needed HTML. To participate the community aspect of the challenge the image should be created in <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a> and shared with the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dailycssimages">&#35;dailycssimages</a> on Twitter. The challenge is run by <a href="http://codingartist.io">Coding Artist</a> and they just started a <a href="http://challenges.codingartist.io/daily-svg-images/">Daily SVG Image</a> challenge I hope to start once I’m done with all 50 days CSS challenge.</p>
<p>On my own I’ve done several CSS images, so with the challenge I decided I wanted to add an extra challenge—use a single element if possible. I was able to do that up until day five, but picked it up in week two…until day 10. So far the last day of each week tends to be a more complex topic and to do what I want visually I set aside that challenge.</p>
<h2 id="week-one">Week One</h2>
<p>Week one of the challenge focused on animals.</p>
<h3 id="day-one-bear-cub">Day One: Bear Cub</h3>
<p>This was so much fun to make. I know it was only the first day, but to kick it off iw</p>

<h3 id="day-two-elephant">Day Two: Elephant</h3>
<p>Alright. This is bad. It looks, well…yeah. But hey, single element!</p>

<h3 id="day-three-beaver">Day Three: Beaver</h3>
<p>The first thing idea I had with this one was the teeth and that it would have to be a pseudo to make the teeth work right. I love how well the teeth came together.</p>

<h3 id="day-four-tiger">Day Four: Tiger</h3>
<p>I had a vision of these green eyes as soon as I read the topic for this day. I figured I would have to do so much more work for the stripes, but the way this came together, the stripes were able to be pretty simple.</p>

<h3 id="day-five-favorite-animated-animal">Day Five: Favorite Animated Animal</h3>
<p>Day five was so freaking hard. I had such a hard time thinking through a favorite animated animal. WALL•E, wait robot, not animal. Buzz Lightyear, again not an animal. Ok, um…well. Thinking through it brought me to the Lion King. As a child of the 90’s this made sense, and it was ripe for the picking. But why, Scar? Maybe it’s Jeremy Irons’ voice that just rings in my ears when I think of that movie. I had this eerie vision of Scar’s yellow eyes bursting out of the shadows. I love how this came together, even though I had to ditch my single element extra challenge, but it was worthwhile.</p>

<h2 id="week-two">Week Two</h2>
<p>After a week full of animals, I assumed there would be an overarching theme for each week. I didn’t quite expect the office supplies of week two, but it turned into a really fun week of challenges.</p>
<h3 id="day-six-clock">Day Six: Clock</h3>
<p>My first picked pen! Single element <em>and</em> animated. So fun.</p>
<p data-height="400" data-theme-id="21151" data-slug-hash="GrbGbJ" data-default-tab="result" data-user="zastrow" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Day 6: Clock" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/zastrow/pen/GrbGbJ/">Day 6: Clock</a> on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p><script async="" src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script></p>
<h3 id="day-seven-ruler">Day Seven: Ruler</h3>
<p>This was my extra challenge of week two. Kept this image a single element, but had an extra twist of adding a print stylesheet that printed up an actual ruler. It isn’t to scale and depends on what browser you print it from, but you know what, it’s still cool.</p>
<p data-height="400" data-theme-id="21151" data-slug-hash="LxwqVz" data-default-tab="result" data-user="zastrow" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Day 7: Ruler" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/zastrow/pen/LxwqVz/">Day 7: Ruler</a> on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p><script async="" src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script></p>
<h3 id="day-eight-note-pad">Day Eight: Note Pad</h3>
<p>After the moving clock, and the (somewhat, not really) usable ruler, what next? I thought about doing a print version again that printed up a blank page. But, I ended up going with <code class="highlighter-rouge">contenteditable</code> and allowing everyone to leave a note for themselves.</p>
<p data-height="400" data-theme-id="21151" data-slug-hash="aJoyOg" data-default-tab="result" data-user="zastrow" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Day 8: Note Pad" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/zastrow/pen/aJoyOg/">Day 8: Note Pad</a> on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p><script async="" src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script></p>
<h3 id="day-nine-calendar">Day Nine: Calendar</h3>
<p>Well, totally missed this on the day. So, I made a simple calendar that displays the day I made it instead of the day of the challenge.</p>
<p>…single element!</p>
<p data-height="400" data-theme-id="21151" data-slug-hash="VpYxeO" data-default-tab="result" data-user="zastrow" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Day 9: Calendar" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/zastrow/pen/VpYxeO/">Day 9: Calendar</a> on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p><script async="" src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script></p>
<h3 id="day-ten-pencil-jar">Day Ten: Pencil Jar</h3>
<p>At this point I am figuring the challenge of each week is going to be complex. I think I like that though. Throughout the week I’ll try to keep a single element and then go crazy on Friday! So, here is a pencil jar, complete with a couple of pencils and <code class="highlighter-rouge">backdrop-filter</code>.</p>
<p data-height="400" data-theme-id="21151" data-slug-hash="MpYXXN" data-default-tab="result" data-user="zastrow" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Day 10: Pencil Jar" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/zastrow/pen/MpYXXN/">Day 10: Pencil Jar</a> on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<p><script async="" src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script></p>
<p>Alright week one and two down. Three more weeks to go, and time allowing I’ll have an update at the end of each week.</p>
