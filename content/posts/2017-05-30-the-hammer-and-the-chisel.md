<p>Weâ€™ve been experimenting with how we work at <a href="https://seesparkbox.com">Sparkbox</a> recently. Our big push has been in understanding where so-called hybrid designer/developers fit in our process. For a long time, these folks have had the title of Developer, with all the other developers. Last Fall, that changed and several of, including me, changed titles to Frontend Designer. The goal was to push the hybrids more into initiating the design work and build up our overall design quality.</p>
<p>Our Content Director, <a href="https://twitter.com/emilykggray">Emily Gray</a>, realized a way for the hybrids to focus on the design-end of coding without the bearing the weight of a full frontend stack. She dubbed this approach the Hammer and the Chisel. Weve had a bit of practice with this approach, and so I decided to <a href="https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/series/designing_design_culture">write about it</a> since I am someone who has filled both roles on different projects. This is the second in a <a href="https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/series/designing_design_culture">multi-part series</a> on revamping our design process at Sparkbox.</p>
