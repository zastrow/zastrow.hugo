<p>I think I’m starting to see how I can utilize Micro.blog. If nothing else, I may get posts to my blog much more often. Right now I have the Micro posts buried in my site, but after some time I may surface them to the rest of the site.</p>
<p>This feels so much like Twitter as a protocol, which has me rather excited for the potential. Even if nothing comes of Micro.blog, how I perceive and interact with my blog has changed. I've never been so optimistic that I could stay on top of posting to my personal website.</p>
