<p>I discovered recently I may have a lactose intolerance. My daughter has a dairy allergy. I <em>know</em> how to avoid dairy. Avoiding it for myself makes it new again. Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t even know what is made of dairy anymore.</p>
<p>In other news this egg and cheese casserole is amazing.  ðŸ¤¤</p>
