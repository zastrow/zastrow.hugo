<p>Started listening to <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38739910-all-the-pieces-matter">All the Pieces Matter: The Inside Story of The Wire</a></em> this morning during my commute. Itâ€™s been so fantastic to hear the origins of this show from the mouths of the writers, producers, and cast members.</p>
