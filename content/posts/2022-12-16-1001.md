I want to see Mastodon succeed. I think the approach makes sense, where anyone can create their own server, but still be connected to the whole network. But, I recognize there is a lot of work to be done and while they have a lot of attention on them, now is when they need financial support which comes through donations.

Join me and support the primary [Mastodon Patreon](https://joinmastodon.org/sponsors). Also, if you are part of an independent instance, see if they need financial support to run the server.
