	OMG you’re looking at my code!!!

	Um, well, this is both exciting and worrisome.

	Ok, first off, if you found something wrong or a bug
	on the site, please, please log an issue at:
	https://github.com/zastrow/zastrow.hugo

	If you’re digging in to look at how this is put
	together, I’ll give a few highlights:

	1. This version is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
		I use my personal site as a place to experiment with
		different CMSs and build systems, so it changes from
		time-to-time.
	2. I’m hosting this on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) because
		its integration between GitHub and static site generators,
		like Hugo, is :chefkiss:
	3. I am a CSS aficionado, if you couldn’t tell from my content.
		As such, I like to play around so be sure too check out the
		source file:
		{{ $style.Permalink | absURL }}

		With this edition of the CSS I’m very excited to be using:
		- CONTAINER QUERIES!!!
		- :HAS() PSEUDO CLASS!!!
		- CSS CUSTOM PROPERTIES!!!
		- ![]({{ $gif.Permalink | absURL }})

	The code is a bit all over the place with some files being space
	indented and other being tab indented. I mentioned in my subhead
	that I’m a Web Accessibility Specialist, and upon learning that
	tab indentation is more accessible, I’ve been slowly working on
	updating my habits and my files.

	But, this is still a work in progress. For a source behind this
	shift, read this article by Alexander Sandberg:
	https://alexandersandberg.com/articles/default-to-tabs-instead-of-spaces-for-an-accessible-first-environment/

	Thanks for checking out my code! If you have any questions
	or want to connect you can reach out via email or Mastodon:

	Thanks!
